Imagine a room filled with 1000 people all trying to figure out a problem.  999 of them will say ” I don’t know what’s wrong” or “It’s not my job”.  The one who stands up and says “Give me a soldering iron, (6) 30 amp three pin twist locks, bailing wire, duct tape, and a pot of black coffee” and ten minutes later is sitting cross legged on the floor sipping his coffee, with a smile, thinking ‘I wonder how much time I have before they’ll need me again’. When somebody has to do it, there’s only one in a thousand that can, That’s a Roadie.
