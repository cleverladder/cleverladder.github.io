#### WHAT IS THE 6 WEEK JOURNEY?

At the beginning of each year, The City Church community gathers together in groups to talk about and go through a shared curriculum. It’s called The 6 Week Journey and this year, on the journey, we will be going through the How’s Your Soul? Study Guide. In our groups, we will watch a weekly video that corresponds to the content in the study guide, and discuss the questions brought up in the video. As a church community, we believe that in these groups we will grow in our relationships with God and with each other. We also have a 6 Week Journey available for City Kids! Each week, they will be able to listen to a new episode from The Isles of VIIM! The Isles of VIIM is a 6-episode radio theater following the adventure of four kids as they explore new lands, meet new creatures, and ultimately find out about the health of their souls. One episode will be made available here each week of the 6 Week Journey. We love you & hope you enjoy the journey!
