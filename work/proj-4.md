April 27, 2011 was a day nobody in this area will ever forget. Tornadoes ripped across our great state and took precious lives and ripped apart everything familiar. Since then, our area has grown together and brought out the best in all of us.

Originally intended to be a one-year celebration of recovery from that horrific day, Rock the South has continued to expand to become a massive celebration of this area and what it has to offer. Since the first Rock the South in 2012, Rock the South has continued to be an important community partner giving back over $200,000 to local charities including The Link, Alabama Forever, Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Alabama and many more.

Stars such as Dierks Bentley, Brantley Gilbert, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Little Big Town, Alan Jackson, Tyler Farr, Travis Tritt, and many more have all partied with our fans in Cullman.

Even as we continue to expand, Rock the South will always be a festival about southern culture, family, and giving back. That will never change.
