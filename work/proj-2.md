For the Love of beer. Such a common, and powerful statement. Beerdid.com is made up by two men, living in Nashville, TN, with exquisite facial hair. Our goal is simple. Educate. Both of us have a love for the craft, and art form that is Beer.

Here’s what you can expect from **Beerdid**:

–A goofy video for each beer we taste.<br>
–We are going to write a little bit about it.<br>
–Tell you what we think.
